/**
 
    1. In the user route for update request, I will send the entire information about the user from the client side (the editable one) and update the one that needs to be changed. I cannot go around creating part for atomic information as it would require creation of a lot of route and controllers. 

    The password in the update route will go through validation but it doesn't matter as it will be the password sent by the user to confirm their update request.

    2. Admin update password functionality.

    3. Email verification functionality.
